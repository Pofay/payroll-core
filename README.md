# payroll-core
This is a practice application that ties in my understanding of the Clean Architecture by Uncle Bob and the tools I would like to specialize in(for now). 

The Clean Architecture tells that the code should not know what medium it is presented or what persistence strategy to use but I'll be using these tools to get a grip on its concepts:

1.) JavaFx to introduce me to UI Presentation patterns such as MVP.
2.) As for persistence I think I might go with MySQL.

For building this Core Library I use the Following:

1.) Maven 
2.) Travis CI

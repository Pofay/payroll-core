# payroll-core
This is a practice application that ties in my understanding of the Clean Architecture by Uncle Bob and the tools I would like to specialize in(for now). 

Although the Clean Architecture implies that the code doesn't know what medium it is presented or what persistence strategy to use but I'll be using these tools to get a grip on its concepts:

1.) Travis CI 
2.) Maven 
3.) JavaFX for the UI
4.) I don't know what database
